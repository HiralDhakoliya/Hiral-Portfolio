# Hi, I'm Hiral Dhakoliya 👋

Computer Science undergraduate focused on building backend-driven systems with strong product thinking.

I don’t build projects for submission.
I build systems to solve structured problems.

My work centers around:
• Database-centric architecture  
• Backend logic & workflow automation  
• Research-backed technical solutions  
• Product-focused decision systems

## 🧠 What I Do

I design and develop:

- Scalable backend systems
- MongoDB-integrated applications
- Automation workflows
- Structured decision-support platforms
- Research-based technical models

I prioritize:
Efficiency > Feature overload  
Clarity > Complexity  
Execution > Ideas
